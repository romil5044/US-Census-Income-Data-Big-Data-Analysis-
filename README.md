Overview - If people don't know, US Census Income Data is a huge dataset containing financial as well

• Performed feature engineering, exploratory analysis & dimensionality reduction to finalize a list of features for ML modelling
• Achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting annual income of employees using logistic regression & random forest models
